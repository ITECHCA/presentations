- As you can see from my slides, I'm not the frontend designer.
- This talk is very introductory on Docker, I'll be showing a very vanilla 
  install without any external vendor tools
  - That also means this isn't a sales pitch
- Send any criticisms to Twitter so that I can block you there.
- If you find any typos, send a PR to my github repo where this presentation
  and others are available. I'll have the full link at the end, but it's
  easy to find with my github name.

name: what-is-a-container
template: inverse

# What is a Container

???

- First a level set, for those that don't know containers

---

# What is a Container

- Process Isolation with a Shared Kernel
- Namespaces: Pids, Filesystem, Network
- Cgroups: Memory and CPU limits
- Minimal Filesystem
- Ephemeral and Immutable

???

- VMs give you an isolated OS, Containers give you an isolated application
- PID namespace: only see your processes, no other OS daemons
- Filesystem is just the dependencies to run your application
- Network isolation give you a private loopback, unique IP
- Ephemeral: containers should be temporary, upgrade by replacing
- Immutability: changes to filesystem are lost when container is replaced
- Data: stored external and mounted into the container (volume)

---

name: bad-for-security
template: inverse

# Containers Are Bad For Security

???

- "True security uses VMs"

---

# Containers Are Bad For Security

- Shared Kernel
- Running Unknown Code
- Lateral Pivoting
- Running as Root
- Docker API Gives Root Access

???

- This is 100% true, 50% of the time
- 78% of statistics are completely made up
- A kernel level exploit gives you access to the host
- Most vulnerabilities are not docker itself but running vulnerable apps
- There have been crypto-coin miners uploaded to the Hub for people to run
- Once in, containers tend to trust containers, easy to laterally pivot
- Docker is a sysadmin level tool that's used by developers
  - The API gives root access to the host
  - Most docker administrative tools mount that API access into a container

---

name: vulnerable-app
template: inverse

# The Vulnerable App

???

- Yes, containers have their security concerns, but lets see how they can
  help security by placing a vulnerable app inside of a container
- This will be a Go app, but most of what we will do applies to other languages

---

# The Vulnerable App

```no-highlight
http.HandleFunc("/rce", rce)
...
func rce(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	script := r.FormValue("script")
	cmd := exec.Command("/bin/sh", "-c", script)
}
```

???

- Lets take an overly simplified vulnerable application
- I did not place this on the network here, for obvious reasons
- It takes any request to /rce, and runs the value of the script parameter
- Easy button example of remote code execution

--

```no-highlight
curl --data-urlencode "script=$*" -X POST localhost:6666/rce
```

???
- To run this, we can use curl with an argument

---

template: terminal

<asciinema-player src="p1-physical.cast" cols=90 rows=24 preload=true font-size=18></asciinema-player>

???

- We have a simple go program, it's an http server with that RCE
- The exploit script is just that curl command
- We can see that commands to this run directly on the host under the user id
- Files created also show up on the host

---

name: dockerize
template: inverse

# Place the App Inside a Container

???

- Now lets place that vulnerable app inside of a container, we'll get
  - Namespaces
  - Limited filesystem

---

# Dockerfile

```no-highlight
FROM golang:latest
WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app/
RUN go build -o app .
CMD ./app
```

???

- The Dockerfile is code/configuration to build an image
- Unlike a Makefile or Ansible Playbook, Dockerfile's start from a known state
  and add just the parts needed to run the application
- The resulting image contains the filesystem and metadata that tells docker
  how to run that image
  - `FROM`, `COPY`, and `RUN` add bits to the filesystem
  - `WORKDIR` and `CMD` add metadata

---

template: terminal

<asciinema-player src="p2-dockerize.cast" cols=90 rows=24 preload=true font-size=18></asciinema-player>

???

- Here's that Dockerfile, nothing up my sleeves
- The build command processes that Dockerfile to generate an image
  - Everything is cached here, it usually takes a little longer than this
- The run command takes that image, which is a template for a container,
  and creates a container
- That didn't work, why can't we connect?

---

# Namespaces

- Docker networking in namespaced, loopback inside the container is private to
  that container.

```no-highlight
$ git diff phase-2-docker phase-3-fix-port
diff --git a/main.go b/main.go
--- a/main.go
+++ b/main.go
@@ -10,7 +10,7 @@ func main() {

 }
```

---

template: terminal

<asciinema-player src="p3-fix-port.cast" cols=90 rows=24 preload=true font-size=18></asciinema-player>

???

- So now we have the change to the http listener for "all interfaces"
- In this case, the image wasn't cached so you can see a more typical delay
- Our exploit now works, we're even root now
- But for some reason we cannot change the hostname to evilcorp
- And we cannot turn back time to have a Y2K party
- We can ping outside the network
- We can load our exploits onto the filesystem
- And as root, we can change the file ownership

---

# Capabilities

- Docker removes capabilities from root inside of the container
- Root inside of a container is not the same as root on the host
- We can add or remove capabilities per container


???

- The reason we cannot do some root tasks inside the container is because
  of reduced capabilities
- Default removed capabilities prevent an escape or modification of the host

---

template: terminal

<asciinema-player src="p4-capabilities.cast" cols=90 rows=24 preload=true font-size=18></asciinema-player>

???

- Here I'm dropping two default capabilities since our app doesn't need them
  - `NET_RAW` gives lower level network access
  - `CHOWN` is exactly what it looks like, changing file ownership
- Now we cannot ping from inside the container
- Nor can we chown the file

---

name: ephemeral
template: inverse

# Ephemeral and Immutable

???

- These two words often get thrown around with containers, but what do we mean?

---

# Ephemeral and Immutable

- Images are immutable
- Containers are ephemeral

???

- Images are the template used to create containers
  - Filesystem and metadata resulting from a build
  - Immutable means we cannot change it, the filesystem layers are fixed
  - You can even cryptographically sign them
  - You don't modify an image, but you can replace it
  - New image will have a new hash, but you can adjust the common tags to
    point to it, similar to DNS pointing to an IP address
- Containers are an instance of an image with namespaces and the running app
  - Filesystem changes in the container are associated with the container
  - Deleting the container deletes those filesystem changes
- Goal is infrastructure as code
  - To make a change, you check-in that change, build a new image, and
    replace the running containers with new ones
  - Eliminates state drift

---

template: terminal

<asciinema-player src="p5-ephemeral.cast" cols=90 rows=24 preload=true font-size=18></asciinema-player>

???

- So lets see an example
  - We run our same container as before
  - We drop in the malware and can see it exists
  - But note this file is inside the container, it doesn't exist on the host
  - So now if we delete and recreate that container, our change is gone
- For an attacker,
  - immutable means you can't mess with the underlying image
  - and ephemeral means your changes will be lost
- For a defender,
  - fixing things often means redeploying a new container
  - but the caution is that you may lose evidence of an attack

---

# What about persistent data?

- Volume mounts in a container store data externally
- A volume can give access to the host
- Data on a volume will often be valuable to attackers
- Backup and versioning of volume data is external to docker

???

- Immutable and Ephemeral are great for apps without data, but most apps
  have some data
- For that you need volume mounts
- Access to the host can also be things like mounting the docker API into a
  management container
- If you `rm -rf` on a volume, the user better have a backup

---

name: user
template: inverse

# Run as a User

---

# Run as a User

- Containers are rarely a multi-user environment
- An escape from the container will not be root on the host
- Linux file permissions protect files inside the container
- Unable to bind to low numbered ports (80, 443)

???

- Inside the container, it's rarely multi-user, and it's ephemeral, so why care?
- Root inside the container has fewer capabilities, but still has some capabilities
- Root is still UID 0 for the filesystem
- So lets run our application as a user instead of root
- Containers often need to work with external volumes and uid of container
  may surprise you when it uses that uid on the host
  - One solution I often use to work around volume permission problems is to
    start as root, fix user permissions (or in my case, change the uid of the
    user inside of the container to match the file owner of the volume), and
    then drop privileges to a user.
- For port binding, we can map a high number container port to a low numbered
  host port
  - An app could start as root bind to a low numbered port, and then drop
    to a normal user.

---

template: terminal

<asciinema-player src="p6-user.cast" cols=90 rows=24 preload=true font-size=18></asciinema-player>

???

- To run a container as a user, you can pass another option
- You could also modify the image, but that's not required, images on the hub
  can still default to root and you can adjust it when you run the container
- We can see the new `id` output showing uid 1000 now
- All the files on the filesystem are still owned by root inside the container
  since that's how we created them
- The `echo echo` isn't a typo, I'm putting an echo command inside of the file
- That means we cannot write our exploit to this directory because of linux
  file permissions
- However, just about any linux environment allows anyone to create files in
  `/tmp` which an attacker can still use

---

name: read-only
template: inverse

# Read Only Filesystems

???

- Show of hands, how many run your VMs or physical host with read only root
  filesystems

---

# Read Only Filesystem

- With containers:
  - Binaries are changed by creating new images
  - Containers are ephemeral
  - Logs are written to stdout
- Why give write access to the filesystem?
- For temp files, we can create mounts with noexec and nosuid options

???

- Why do containers need write access to the filesystem?
  - Not for binaries, not for data inside the container, not for logs
- So lets make that filesystem read-only
- However, volumes and temp directories will still be an issue, but a
  reduced risk because we can mount volumes without exec access

---

template: terminal

<asciinema-player src="p7-read-only.cast" cols=90 rows=24 preload=true font-size=18></asciinema-player>

???

- The read-only flag applies to the entire root filesystem
- The tmpfs mount adds a volume, stored in memory, with 1777 file permissions,
  at /app/run, could be anywhere
- When we try to write to /tmp, we see that the filesystem is read-only,
  even though file permissions would normally allow it
- From the mount output we see `/` is `ro`, but `/app/run` is `rw`
- Trying to run code in `/app/run` encounters the `noexec` flag set on the mount
- But a script is just data, you can run `sh` and pass the script as input
- If `python`, `java`, `node`, or any other interpreter/runtime exists, we
  can ship a payload that doesn't require exec access.

---

name: scratch
template: inverse

# No Filesystem

???

- As long as we have a shell, we have an issue
- So lets get rid of everything

---

# No Filesystem

- Docker's `scratch` filesystem contains nothing
- No shells to run, no libraries, no compilers
- App must be statically compiled
- Must include all dependencies

???

- When you think scratch, think `rm -rf` or `format c:`

---

template: terminal

<asciinema-player src="p8-scratch.cast" cols=90 rows=24 preload=true font-size=18></asciinema-player>

???

- I'm using Docker's multi-stage build to compile my go app in one image,
  and copy the resulting binary to a second image that I run
- The two `FROM` lines indicate this is a multi-stage, with `as` for each stage name
- For the build command I need to disable CGO to avoid dynamic links to libc
- I'm moving the user into the image instead of defining it at run time
- The `COPY --from=build` takes the file from another image or stage
- The run command is the same except for removing the user specification
- Our first attempt fails because appuser doesn't exist in the scratch image
- We need to copy dependencies like passwd over, I've added TLS certs and
  timezones as additional examples you may want to copy
- The second attempt fails because /bin/sh doesn't exist, but where do we call
  that? It's embedded in the `CMD` syntax. We need to switch to a json format
  to run the binary with a Linux `exec` syscall instead of a `/bin/sh` shell.
- Our third attempt didn't seem to do anything, lets add some error handling
- Now we can see that /bin/sh doesn't exist, so our exploit is now failing
- To understand better what scratch looks like, lets build an image that
  copies all the files from our scratch image, and run a simple find command
- In the find output, we see our app, some /etc/ files we copied, way too
  many timezones, but no /bin, not /var, no /home, no /lib, not even /tmp

---

# Minimal Filesystem

- Even if you can't go `scratch`, go minimal
- Avoid compilers, editors, or other administrative tools
- Have a separate developer image for debugging
- Do not run that developer image in production

???

- That was an extreme example, but one seen in a fair number of containers
  that are built on compiled code like Go lang.
- If you can't do that, at least minimize, use a JRE instead of JDK
- Don't include the tools an attacker can use against you, no nmap in your
  production containers
- If your developers need a full debugging environment, have that in a
  separate image that you do not run in prod. I've seen multi-stage designs
  with build, dev, unit test, image scanning, and prod release.

template: inverse

# Containers Are Good For Security

???

- So we've come full circle, despite all the negatives, containers are good

---

# Containers Are Good For Security

- Additional layer of defense
- Remove tools for attackers to use
- Remove capabilities and access at a per app level
- Lock down the filesystem: read-only and noexec

???

- You can use VMs with containers for higher security requirements

---

name: advanced
template: inverse

# Advanced Mode

---

# Advanced Mode

- User Namespaces
- Syscalls: Seccomp, Sysdig, Falco
- Runtimes: Gvisor, Kata, Firecracker
- Image scanning: Clair, Anchore, Aqua, DTR
- Image signing: Notary / Content Trust
- Docker API: Twistlock, Open Policy Agent (OPA), UCP
- Service Mesh: Istio, Envoy
- CIS: Docker Bench Security

???

- User Namespaces are built right into docker, but I say it's advanced because
  enabling them breaks common use cases with host volumes.
  - Root inside the container will now be uid 10,000 on the host
  - Set on daemon, not per container, and all images need to be pulled again
- Seccomp: profile your application, and only enable the syscalls it needs
  - Docker provides a default profile
- Sysdig: uses a kernel module and eBPF to monitor and notify
  - Sysdig is reactive, seccomp is proactive
  - Sysdig/Falco is more granular, policies on specific binaries or conditions
- Gvisor: user space kernel, intercepts syscalls before passing through
  - provided by Google, faster than a VM, doesn't support every app
- Kata containers: runs container in a VM, still susceptible to VM exploits (qemu)
- Firecracker: released by AWS, hopefully less vulnerable than Qemu
- Image scanning: verifies there are no known vulnerabilities
  - Information overload, no details if vulnerability is in critical path
  - Make sure your scanner checks for binaries installed outside of the package manager
- Image signing: key management headache, is an image more trustworthy when
  someone in the org signs it (did you verify they started from a trusted source)?
- Docker API limits by either an AuthZ plugin or completely proxy the API
  - Easier to not give users any access at all, only let CI/CD touch API directly
- Service Mesh's give you an application level firewall capability with a zero
  trust foundation. Connections between services are encrypted, mTLS verification.
  These are still relatively immature, but a key piece of blocking lateral attacks.
- The Center for Internet Security puts out guidelines for various products
  including Docker. Docker has that implemented in a container based scanner
  you can run. Checks from this are overly paranoid IMO, and extend beyond
  security.

# Before Going to Production

- Orchestration: Kubernetes, Swarm
- CI/CD: Automate, do not deploy by hand
- Metrics: OpenMetrics, Prometheus, Grafana
- Logging: Elastic, Splunk
- Tracing: OpenTracing, Jagger

???

- Orchestration gives the high availability while supporting deployments/upgrades
- CI/CD: automation, users shouldn't touch prod
- Metrics: known when you are reaching capacity, DDOS
- Logging: containers are ephemeral, and so are their logs, export them to a central source
- Tracing: provides a browser developer tools waterfall like view of networking
  calls but for requests through multiple layers of microservices on the server
  - Joke: microservices turns every outage into a murder mystery

- If I haven't dumped enough tools on you, the CNCF has a long list of other tools and vendors

---

# Don't Skip the Basics

- Trusted base image
- Minimal images
- Run as a user
- Read only filesystem
- Patch and Update Regularly
- Protect the docker API

???

- The key take away I hope you have is that all these tools are great, but
  with some basic built-in functionality, we can turn a soft target into a
  hardened bunker
