???

- This talk is geared towards people that have a working knowledge of docker.

- Most of this talk is answering different questions, if you get lost at any
  point, sit tight for a minute and we'll get to a different question.

- I've answered almost 1k questions on the docker tag on SO. But why?

---

# How Do We Learn?

???

- I wanted to learn Docker inside out. Partially for curiosity, partially
because I really enjoyed working with it, and mostly because it was my new job.

--

- RTFM

- Practice

- Drills

- Teaching

???

- Docker has some fine docs, and where it's lacking, you can always submit PR's.

- Play With Docker gets you quick practice.

- Drills to me is working through a list of questions, and implies that the
  answer is already there and you're just trying to remember it.

- Teaching requires you learn something well enough to explain it to others.

- The last two sum up StackOverflow for me.

- I don't learn docker so I can answer questions

- I answer questions so I can learn docker

---

# Typical StackOverflow User Background

- Mostly developers

- Often more comfortable with an IDE than a CLI

- DevOps is shifting those Devs into more Ops tasks

- Pro: devs no longer depend on ops to manage their app runtime environment

--

- Con: devs no longer depend on ops to manage their app runtime environment

- Devs are now learning OS/Linux/distributions, scripting, package managers,
  networking, and storage.

???
- The result: lots of smart developers making common mistakes.

# General Docker Questions

---

# Q: How do containers differ from VM's

- Containers have a shared kernel, application isolation vs hardware isolation

- How do we change the mindset of people using containers as a lightweight VM?

???

- Namesapces and cgroups, not virtualized hardware.

- Yet people still cram 5 different apps into a single container and upgrade
  in place, how do we change that?

--

  - Who likes uptime?

???

- Everyone with their hands down are probably texting their boss to explain why
  everything is down equals "working as designed".

--

  - Who wants to maintain a server that hasn't been rebooted for 3 years, and
    the original admin has left?

???

- It's got uptime, probably vulnerable to spectre/meltdown and lots of other
  exploits, along with being a really old framework no one likes.

--
  - Uptime quickly becomes a ticking time bomb.

???

- Upgrades are out of the question since you don't know what could break or how
  to fix it or how to revert. There's a transition point where uptime goes from
  desired to risky.

- That transition point is as soon as you get state drift.

--

- What we want is availability, not uptime. We want a LB pointing to replicas
  spread across multiple AZ's so we can have __low uptime__ and __high availability__.

???

- The fix is continuous delivery, infrastructure as code, immutability and disposability.

- People using containers as lightweight VM's are making pets, they'll end up
  a 3 year old container that no one knows how it works. Those doing it right
  will manage a farm of cattle.

---

# Q: How do containers differ from VM's

Practical differences:

- Don't ssh into containers (exec, and only in dev)

- Don't upgrade containers in place (replace them)

- Don't install multiple apps inside a single container (compose files)

- Don't give containers static IP's (LB/reverse proxies)

- Don't backup containers (backup volumes)

- Don't export containers to make new images (use a Dockerfile)

???

- Treat containers as immutable and disposable.

- Learn from others mistakes:

  - The worst answer I had to give to someone was that they wasted months of work
    and had to start all over.
  - They had been maintaining their container without a Dockerfile, applying
    updates in place, and periodically running an export / import. 
  - One day they lost their image, maybe they ran a bad rmi, maybe filesystem
    corruption, maybe they hit the layer limit.
  - A Dockerfile and versioned images would give them not only a quick way to
    revert, but also to completely recreate without some of the day 1 cruft.

# Dockerfile

---

# <span class="bg-white">Q: What's the difference between the string and json syntax?</span>

- RUN, CMD, and ENTRYPOINT can each use either syntax

- The string syntax includes a shell, `/bin/sh -c "${cmd}"` by default.

- The json syntax executes the command directly, without a shell.

???

--

.left-column[
Shell Pros:
- Expands variables
- Command chaining (`&&`)
- I/O redirection
]

--

.right-column[
Shell Cons:
- Intercepts signals
- Extra processing to merge entrypoint with cmd
]

---

# <span class="bg-white">Q: What's the difference between the string and json syntax?</span>

String/Shell Syntax:

```
RUN echo hello world
ENTRYPOINT /entrypoint.sh
CMD run a b c
```

--

Json/Exec Syntax:

```
RUN ["echo", "hello", "world"]
ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]
CMD ["run", "a", "b", "c"]
```

???

- If you have any typos, invalid quotes, missing commas or bracket, docker will
  treat the bad json as a string to run.

---

# <span class="bg-white">Q: What's the difference between the string and json syntax?</span>

What if cmd is a string and you have an entrypoint?

```no-highlight
/entrypoint.sh /bin/sh -c "args to entrypoint"
```

--

To fix this in the entrypoint:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
if [ $# -gt 1 -a "$1" = "/bin/sh" -a "$2" = "-c" ]; then
  shift 2
  eval "set -- $1"
fi
exec "$@"
```

???

- The final `exec` is what makes an entrypoint transparent to the command being
  run. Pid 1 gets replaced by the command and any initialization may be done
  before the command is executed.

---

# Q: Why doesn't build use the cache?

.left-column[
Cache requires:

- Same command to be run

- Same checksum on all files

- Same previous layer

- Image was built locally
]

--

.right-column[
Cache can be broken by:

- Changing a build `ARG` value

- Changing a timestamp

- The previous layer being rebuilt
]

--

.no-column[
To trust images pulled from a registry, use:
```
docker build --cache-from my_image ...
```
]

---

# Q: Why is my image so large?

How big are the layers resulting from this Dockerfile:
```
FROM busybox

RUN mkdir /data
RUN dd if=/dev/zero bs=1024 count=1024 of=/data/one
RUN chmod -R 0777 /data
RUN dd if=/dev/zero bs=1024 count=1024 of=/data/two
RUN chmod -R 0777 /data
RUN rm /data/one

CMD ls -alh /data
```

???

- 5 commands:
  - Create 1M /data/one
  - Change permissions
  - Create 1M /data/two
  - Change permissions
  - Remove /data/one

- This could easily be:
  - Download code from git
  - Extract code
  - Compile app
  - Make app executable
  - Remove download and source

---

# Q: Why is my image so large?

- Running the image you see the 1MB file:
  ```
  -rwxrwxrwx    1 root     root        1.0M May 12 00:14 two
  ```

- Each `dd` command adds a 1MB layer.

--

- Each `chmod` command will change permissions and copy the entire 1MB file
  to the next layer.

--

- What does the `rm` command do to the image size?

---

class: small

# Q: Why is my image so large?

The `rm` command only changes directory metadata in the next layer:


```
Step 6/7 : RUN chmod -R 0777 /data
 ---> Running in 038bd2bc5aea
* ---> 77793bf30d5f
Step 7/8 : RUN rm /data/one
 ---> Running in 504c6e9b6637
* ---> 9fe0e2f18893
...

$ docker image ls -a | grep 77793bf30d5f
REPOSITORY     TAG           IMAGE ID         CREATED             SIZE
<none>         <none>        77793bf30d5f     10 minutes ago      6.37MB
$ docker image ls -a | grep 9fe0e2f18893
REPOSITORY     TAG           IMAGE ID         CREATED             SIZE
<none>         <none>        9fe0e2f18893     10 minutes ago      6.37MB
```

---

# Q: Why is my image so large?

- Resulting 1MB file has become 4MB on disk and over the network

- Compare the two resulting images to see the added disk space:
  ```
  REPOSITORY   TAG     IMAGE ID      CREATED         SIZE
  busybox      latest  54511612f1c4  8 months ago    1.13MB
  test-layers  latest  757ce49dd12f  10 minutes ago  6.37MB
  ```

- Subtracting the two you get the expected ~5MB

---

# Q: Why is my image so large?

- 5MB? Not 4MB? Where did the extra 1MB come from?

```
FROM busybox
RUN mkdir /data
RUN dd if=/dev/zero bs=1024 count=1024 of=/data/one
RUN chmod -R 0777 /data
RUN dd if=/dev/zero bs=1024 count=1024 of=/data/two
RUN chmod -R 0777 /data
RUN rm /data/one
CMD ls -alh /data
```

--

- A `chmod` or `chown` changes a timestamp on the file
  _even when there is no permission or ownership change made_.

???

- The recursive `chmod` and `chown` commands you run to fix permissions and run
  will always include every file in that directory in the new layer.

---

# Q: Why is my image so large?

How can we examine layers? Build with `docker build --rm=false .`

```
...
Step 2/7 : RUN mkdir /data
* ---> Running in 04c5fa1360b0
 ---> 9b4368667b8c
Step 3/7 : RUN dd if=/dev/zero bs=1024 count=1024 of=/data/one
* ---> Running in f1b72db3bfaa
1024+0 records in
1024+0 records out
1048576 bytes (1.0MB) copied, 0.006002 seconds, 166.6MB/s
 ---> ea2506fc6e11
```

???

- This leaves the temporary containers around used during the build

- Docker used to leave them around by default, but they took up space and
  people rarely used them

- Until now...

---

# Q: Why is my image so large?

Check each temp image with `docker diff ${cid}`

.small[
```
$ docker diff 04c5fa1360b0  # mkdir /data
A /data
*$ docker diff f1b72db3bfaa  # dd if=/dev/zero bs=1024 count=1024 of=/data/one
C /data
*A /data/one
*$ docker diff 81c607555a7d  # chmod -R 0777 /data
C /data
*C /data/one
$ docker diff 1bd249e1a47b  # dd if=/dev/zero bs=1024 count=1024 of=/data/two
C /data
A /data/two
*$ docker diff 038bd2bc5aea  # chmod -R 0777 /data
*C /data/one
*C /data/two
$ docker diff 504c6e9b6637  # rm /data/one
C /data
*D /data/one
```
]

???

- The `/data/one` file is created once with `A`, changed twice (`C`), and then
  it's deleted (`D`) which also changes the metadata on `/data`.

- Each of these `docker diff` commands is a view into the layered filesystem,
  and every layer is shipped with an image, it's not squashed automatically.

---

# Q: Why is my image so large?

### Reduce the image size by merging RUN lines:

.small[
```no-highlight
FROM busybox

RUN mkdir /data \
 && dd if=/dev/zero bs=1024 count=1024 of=/data/one \
 && chmod -R 0777 /data \
 && dd if=/dev/zero bs=1024 count=1024 of=/data/two \
 && chmod -R 0777 /data \
 && rm /data/one

CMD ls -alh /data
```
]

```
REPOSITORY    TAG      IMAGE ID      CREATED             SIZE
busybox       latest   54511612f1c4  8 months ago        1.13MB
test-layers2  latest   951252cf34ed  25 seconds ago      2.18MB
```

???

- Merge the `RUN` commands by joining each command with a `&&` and span
  multiple lines with a `\`.

- The previous 5MB of layers is now just an added 1MB.

- Do the same when downloading source or temporary files, same with
  apt-get update/clean, do those in the same RUN line.

---

template: inverse

# Run

---

# Q: What does "invalid reference format" mean?

- A reference is a pointer to an image.

- The docker command line is order dependent:
  ```
  docker ${docker_args} run ${run_args} image ${cmd}
  ```

- Frequently happens when an invalid arg gets parsed as the image name or
  invalid characters from copy/pasting from a source that changes dashes
  and quotes.

- What does docker interpret as the image name here:
  ```
  my project$ docker run -it —rm -v $(pwd):/data “my_image”
  ```

???

- References can be the image name and tag, name and default to latest, image id,
  with or without a registry, or it can be pinned to a sha256 hash.

- The first thing after the run command that isn't a valid arg is treated as
  the image reference.

- Commonly see with wrong type of `-`, "smart" quotes, unquoted paths with spaces.

- In the example, there are three different errors, `--rm` has an em-dash,
  the volume path isn't quoted and contains a space, and left/right quotes 
  are used around my_image.
  - First: `—rm`
  - Next: `project:/data`
  - Then: `“my_image”` (with left/right quotes)
 
---

# Q: Why do I get "executable not found"?

- Did you run the intended command?
  ```no-highlight
  docker run --rm my_image -it echo hello world
  ```

- Is docker trying to run a json string?

- Does the file exist... in the path and inside the container?

- If it is a shell script, check the first line 
  ```no-highlight
  #!/bin/bash
  ```

- If it is a binary, there is likely a missing library

???

- The `-it` is not an executable, everything after my_image is a command to run

- If docker is trying to run your "json" CMD/ENTRYPOINT, there's likely a typo
  or other invalid json causing it to be processed as a string.

- People try to run commands on their laptop inside the container. We have
  filesystem namespacing, which means containers cannot see the laptop directories
  (unless you have a volume mount). The path for exec may not have everything
  an interactive shell in the container has, login scripts aren't run.

- If it's not executable, fix it with a `chmod`, preferably in the same layer where
  the file was created to reduce layer size.

- Alpine, busybox, and some other images don't ship with bash out of the box.

- Statically compiled go libraries still have some library dependencies without 
  a few extra flags. If you compile on ubuntu and run on alpine, the musl libc
  will not work.

---

# Q: What is this TTY error?

```no-highlight
the input device is not a TTY
```

- The TTY is a terminal in linux

- `docker run -it`: Interactive terminal

- `docker run -i `: Input but no terminal, piping in a file

- `docker run -t `: Setup terminal but no input, color output in logs

- `docker run    `: No input, no terminal, typically used for scripts/cron/ci-cd

???

- A terminal is more than just a stream of text, lets the cursor move around and
  supports colors.

- This error is typically seen when you run docker by a script or in some
  automation tool (Jenkins).

# Networking

---

# Q: EXPOSE vs Publishing a port?

- EXPOSE

  - Documentation from the image creator to the person running the image

  - Not needed to publish

  - Not needed for container-to-container communication

- Publish

  - Maps a port on the host to connect to a port in the container.

  - One-way, from host to container, it does not allow containers
    to access applications running on the host.

???

- Neither of these apply to container-to-container communication.

---

# <span class="bg-white">Q: Networking issues between containers?</span>

- Make sure app is listening on 0.0.0.0, not 127.0.0.1

- Use a user generated network

- Use DNS: container id, container name, service name, or network alias

- Connect to the container port, not the host published port

- With overlay networking, open 7946/both, 4789/tcp, and protocol 50.

???

- When moving an app from host to container, networking needs to change
  to use multiple namespaced networks instead of a global host network.

---

# <span class="bg-white">Q: Networking issues between containers?</span>

## Follow-up Q: Do I need to expose the port?
- Nope, expose is documentation.

## Follow-up Q: Do I need to publish the port?
- Nope, that only makes the container accessible from outside of docker.

## Follow-up Q: Do I need links?
- Nope, links are deprecated, use user created networks.

???

- Any container with a common user created network can talk to every port
  of the other container, no expose, publish, or linking needed.

- Linking is what we had before user generated networks, you still need that
  if you don't create a network for your container, but it's not recommended.

--

## Follow-up Q: What's a network alias?
- You can give containers or services additional names on any network.

???

- Aliases are many-to-many. One container can have many of aliases. Many
  containers can have the same alias (DNSRR).

---

# <span class="bg-white">Q: Networking issues accessing published port?</span>

- Make sure app is listening on 0.0.0.0, not 127.0.0.1.

- Connect to an IP on the host, not the 0.0.0.0 listener wildcard.

- Verify the publish command. `-p 8080:80` maps host port 8080 to container
  port 80.

- With overlay networking, open 7946/both, 4789/tcp, and protocol 50.

- <span class="bg-white">
  Verify the docker host you are using with `echo $DOCKER_HOST`. If this is
  set, connect to that IP instead.</span>

???

- Docker doesn't control how the app listens, only where the forwarded
  traffic goes

- Every container can listen internally on the same port without conflict,
  that's what network namespacing gives you. People often reverse the port
  order. My way of remembering is you can publish to a specific IP on the
  host, and if so, that's `host_ip:host_port:container_port`

- Overlay networking needs ports opened between docker nodes in the swarm.
  Protocol 50 is not tcp or udp, it's a different protocol, for IPSec only.

- IP `0.0.0.0` is only for servers listening, not clients connecting. The
  web server listens on all network interfaces, but the web browser only
  connects to a single IP address.

---

# Networking Tips

## Follow-up Q: How to check if the app is listening on 0.0.0.0?

```
docker run -it --rm --net container:${cid}
  nicolaka/netshoot netstat -lnt
```

???

- There are several network types: host, overlay, bridge, and none. There's
  also using the network namespace of another container.

--

## Follow-up Q: Why doesn't localhost work?

- IPv6 is the likely cause, use 127.0.0.1 instead.

???

- For commands run inside the container (including healthcheck), the container
  /etc/host may have an IPv6 entry even when not enabled in docker.

---

template: inverse

# Volumes

---

# Q: Build isn't updating a directory?

Typically caused by a volume:

- A volume attached to the container persists the old state

- A volume defined in the image prevents changes to that directory

???

- For volumes defined on the container, the image is being updated.

- Images are created with temporary containers, the temp containers get a
  temporary volume attached, only changes to the container filesystem are
  saved, changes to the temp volume are discarded.

- You can `COPY` and `ADD` content into a directory defined as a `VOLUME`.

---

# PSA: Remove VOLUME in Dockerfiles

- Users cannot extend the image

- Anonymous volumes clutter the filesystem

- Not required for creating volumes at runtime

???

- Adding initial data for an image is a common extension that volumes block

- Anonymous volumes are where data goes to get lost

--

- Solution: define volumes in a compose file

---

# <span class="bg-white">Q: How do I handle UID/GID and permission issues with host volumes?</span>

- Option 1: `chmod 777`

- Option 2: Update image user to match host uid/gid

- Option 3: Use named volumes an manage data with containers

- Option 4: Correct permissions with entrypoint

???

- Opt 1 is a cop-out

- Opt 2 is not portable

- Opt 3 works as long as you don't need host volumes

- Opt 4 requires suid command or starting container as root

---

## <span class="bg-white">Q: How do I handle UID/GID and permission issues?</span>

Option 2: Update image to match host uid/gid:

```
FROM debian:latest
ARG UID=1000
ARG GID=1000
RUN groupadd -g $GID cuser \
 && useradd -m -u $UID -g $GID -s /bin/bash cuser
USER cuser
```

```
$ docker build \
  --build-arg UID=$(id -u) --build-arg GID=$(id -g) .
```

???

- Only need to match uid/gid, username and groupname can be different

- Not portable if UID/GID isn't common across all docker hosts

---

## <span class="bg-white">Q: How do I handle UID/GID and permission issues?</span>

Option 4: Entrypoint to correct uid/gid:

```
FROM jenkins/jenkins:lts
*USER root
RUN  apt-get update \
* && wget -O /usr/local/bin/gosu "https://github.com/..." \
  && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/gosu \
  && curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh \
  && usermod -aG docker jenkins
*COPY entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh
*ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]
```

???

- To use an entrypoint I've:
  - run the container as root
  - installed gosu
  - created the user/group
  - copied in the entrypoint

- I've removed error handling and cleanup steps to fit on the slide

---

## <span class="bg-white">Q: How do I handle UID/GID and permission issues?</span>

Option 4: Entrypoint to correct uid/gid:

```no-highlight
#!/bin/sh

# if image and volume gid do not match, modify container user
SOCK_DOCKER_GID=$(ls -ng /var/run/docker.sock | cut -f3 -d' ')
CUR_DOCKER_GID=$(getent group docker | cut -f3 -d: || true)
if [ "$SOCK_DOCKER_GID" != "$CUR_DOCKER_GID" ]; then
*  groupmod -g ${SOCK_DOCKER_GID} docker
fi

# drop access to jenkins user and run jenkins entrypoint
*exec gosu jenkins /bin/tini -- /usr/local/bin/jenkins.sh "$@"
```

???

- I've removed error handling and cleanup steps to fit on the slide

- The last line:
  - `exec` removes the shell from pid 1, replaces with `gosu`
  - `gosu` drops access from root to jenkins, and does an internal exec to `tini`
  - `tini` is a small init to reap zombie processes, and launches `jenkins.sh`
  - `jenkins.sh` runs the app

- Done this way, the entrypoint is transparent to the user and container process,
  they only notice the file permissions in the container always match where ever
  they run the container

- A `docker exec` will still run as root, but app will run as jenkins

---

# Q: How to initialize a host volume from image?

- Option 1: Don't. Initialize outside of docker, before starting the container

- Option 2: Copy with an entrypoint from a saved location in the image.

???

- Opt 1: pay attention to uid/gid's.

- Opt 2: if the image is run without a host vol, then use a symlink inside
  the image from /data to /data-save

--

- Option 3: Define a named volume that's a bind mount.

```no-highlight
$ docker volume create --driver local \
  --opt type=none \
  --opt device=/home/user/test \
  --opt o=bind \
  test_vol
```

???

- Opt 3: Docker will initialize named volumes, but the directory must exist in
  advance for the bind mount to succeed (unlike host volumes)

---

## Q: How to initialize a host volume from image?

Walk-through of example 3 - Dockerfile:

```no-highlight
FROM busybox:latest
RUN adduser --home /home/user --uid 5001 \
    --disabled-password user
USER user
*COPY --chown=user sample-data/ /home/user/data/
```

???

- We've made a user, and copied in some sample data to the image.

---

## Q: How to initialize a host volume from image?

Walk-through of example 3 - Sample data:

```

-rw-r--r--  1 bmitch bmitch  214 Jan 22  2017 tar-file.tgz
```

???

- This gets loaded into the image

- We have to create the directory on the host first, same for any 
  bind/nfs/etc mount.

- The volume create could also be done in a compose.yml file. Slightly
  different syntax.

## Q: How to initialize a host volume from image?

Walk-through of example 3 - Run the container:

```no-highlight
$ docker run -it --rm -v test-vol:/home/user/data test-vol \
  /bin/sh -c "\
    echo hello world >/home/user/data/inside-container.txt \
    && ls -l /home/user/data"
total 20
drwxr-xr-x  2 user   user   4096 May 14 13:43 dir
-rw-r--r--  1 user   user     12 Jan 23  2017 file.txt
-rw-r--r--  1 user   user     14 Jan 23  2017 file2.txt
*-rw-r--r--  1 user   user     12 May 14 13:43 inside-container.txt
-rw-r--r--  1 user   user    214 Jan 23  2017 tar-file.tgz
```

???

- Run the container, using the named volume mount

- Volume was initialized even though it's a "host" volume

- Created the "inside-container.txt" file by the container

- Note the container owns everything as "user"

## Q: How to initialize a host volume from image?

Walk-through of example 3 - Show the local directory from the host:

```
$ ls -al test-vol/
total 28
drwxr-sr-x  3   5001   5001 4096 May 14 09:43 .
drwxr-xr-x 30 bmitch bmitch 4096 May 14 09:41 ..
drwxr-xr-x  2   5001   5001 4096 May 14 09:43 dir
-rw-r--r--  1   5001   5001   14 Jan 22  2017 file2.txt
-rw-r--r--  1   5001   5001   12 Jan 22  2017 file.txt
-rw-r--r--  1   5001   5001   12 May 14 09:43 inside-container.txt
-rw-r--r--  1   5001   5001  214 Jan 22  2017 tar-file.tgz
```

???

- Note the uid matches the image uid, this doesn't solve the uid mapping issue

- Combine this with previous uid/gid entrypoint fix for best of both
