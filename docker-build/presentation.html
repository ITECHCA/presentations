# What is Docker?

???

- First a quick level set for anyone that doesn't already know Docker
- Who's already using Docker?

---

# What is Docker?

- App vs OS isolation
  - Shared kernel vs shared hardware
- Kernel namespaces
  - Mount, PID, Network, User, UTS, IPC
- Package and Ship Images
  - Filesystem + metadata
- Run Images as Containers
  - Running process with some settings

???

- Most namespaces (except for filesystem) can be adjusted
- Mount for filesystems
- UTS is for the hostname
- IPC for inter process comm

---

# Image Filesystem Layers

- Filesystems are packaged in layers, diff on previous filesystem state
- Layers are read-only once created
- Images may share layers
- Containers merge the read-only image layers plus a read-write container layer
- Write to a container filesystem performs a copy-on-write to read-write layer

---

# Dockerfile

- List of instructions to create an image
- Each instruction adds a new layer or sets some metadata
- Start from a known initial state, base image

???

- Starting from a known state is why I like containers vs other CM tools
- Avoids state drift when you always begin at a known state

---

# Where's the Go Code?

???

- This is a Go meetup, let's talk Go

---

template: code
class: small

# Hello World

```go
package main

import (
	"flag"
	"fmt"
	"html/template"
	log "github.com/sirupsen/logrus"
	"net/http"
	"os"
	"runtime"
)

var (
	httpAddr   *string
	serverName *string
)
```
???
- Sadly, I'm here to learn Go more than to teach it, so you get a hello world

---

template: code
class: small

# Hello World

```go
func init() {
	hostname, _ := os.Hostname()
	httpAddr = flag.String("http", ":8080", "Listen address")
	serverName = flag.String("server", hostname, "Server Name")
}

func main() {
	flag.Parse()
	http.HandleFunc("/", root)
	fmt.Print("Ready to receive requests on port 8080\n")
	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(*httpAddr, nil))
}

func root(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	path := "unknown"
	if (len(r.URL.Path) > 1) {
		path = r.URL.Path[1:]
	}

```
???
- I've got an app listening on port 8080 for http requests
- I take the URL from those requests
---

template: code
class: small

# Hello World

```go
	data := struct {
		ServerName, Path, OS, Arch string
	}{
		*serverName, path, runtime.GOOS, runtime.GOARCH,
	}
	w.Header().Set("Server", "Hello Server")
	w.WriteHeader(200)
	err := tmpl.Execute(w, data)
	if (err != nil) {
		log.Print(err)
	}
}

var tmpl = template.Must(template.New("tmpl").Parse(`
<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><center>
	<h2 style="color:blue">Hello {{.Path}} from {{.ServerName}}</h2>
	<h3>Running on OS: {{.OS}}, Arch: {{.Arch}}</h3>
</center></body></html>
`))
```

???
And respond with a template that includes
- URL
- server name (hostname)
- OS
- Arch

# Lets Package This In Docker

???
- So that was a huge let down to the Go devs
- Maybe I can show you some cool docker stuff instead
---

template: code

# Dockerfile: External Build

```Dockerfile
FROM debian:latest
COPY app /app
RUN chmod 755 /app
CMD /app
```
???
- Here's a first attempt at a Dockerfile
- It assumes we build the app outside of docker
- The instructions are fairly easy to read
  - FROM defines a parent image, all images need a starting point
  - COPY takes a file/dir from the context (build input) and adds it to our image
  - RUN executes a command inside of a temporary container and saves the changes to the filesystem
  - CMD is metadata saying how to run this image as a container (default)
---

template: terminal

<asciinema-player src="demo-external.cast" cols=100 rows=26 preload=true font-size=17></asciinema-player>

---

template: inverse

# Compile with Docker

???
- If docker does the compile, we can avoid dependencies on developer machines
- This also means one app could use a newer version of Go than another, on the same machine

---

template: terminal

<asciinema-player src="demo-byhand.cast" cols=100 rows=26 preload=true font-size=17></asciinema-player>

???
- Before I create an image, I like to run commands by hand interactively
- Makes for faster debugging

---

name: debian
template: inverse

# Compile During Build

???
- Lets get to the real world, no one is compiling by hand on the CI server for every check-in
- Lets take our steps from the by-hand install and make a Dockerfile that does the compile

---

template: code

# Dockerfile: Debian v1

```Dockerfile
FROM golang:1.12
RUN adduser --disabled-password --gecos appuser appuser
WORKDIR /src
COPY . /src/
RUN go build -o app .
WORKDIR /
RUN cp /src/app /app
RUN chown appuser /app
RUN chmod 755 /app
RUN rm -r /src
USER appuser
CMD /app
```
???
- Here's almost a literal translation to our by-hand steps
- Ops jumped in and required that we not run stuff as root
- But before you take notes on this, realize it's version 1 and a horrible example

---

template: terminal

<asciinema-player src="demo-debian1.cast" cols=100 rows=26 preload=true font-size=17></asciinema-player>
???
- Before I get to bad mouthing it too much, lets see that it works

---

template: code

# Dockerfile: Debian v1

```Dockerfile
FROM golang:1.12
RUN adduser --disabled-password --gecos appuser appuser
WORKDIR /src
COPY . /src/
RUN go build -o app .
WORKDIR /
RUN cp /src/app /app
RUN chown appuser /app
RUN chmod 755 /app
RUN rm -r /src
USER appuser
CMD /app
```
???
- What's wrong with it?
- We don't cleanup all the go cache
- Once RUN finishes, those files are in the image and shipped

---

template: code

# Dockerfile: Debian v2

```Dockerfile
FROM golang:1.12
RUN adduser --disabled-password --gecos appuser appuser
COPY . /src/
*RUN  cd /src \
* && go build -o app . \
* && cd / \
* && cp /src/app /app \
* && chown appuser /app \
* && chmod 755 /app \
* && rm -r /go/pkg /root/.cache/go-build /src
USER appuser
*CMD [ "/app" ]
```
???
- So the fix is we chain our RUN commands, 
  delete files in the same step where they are created
- This doesn't help with the COPY of /src
- I also switched CMD to have json syntax, with a string there's an extra shell
  run that we don't need, it would intercept and block SIGTERM

---

template: terminal

<asciinema-player src="demo-debian2.cast" cols=100 rows=26 preload=true font-size=17></asciinema-player>
???
- So that works
- And we shrink our image
- We aren't anywhere near the size of external image, because now we ship a compiler
- But first, there's an alpine image that's smaller, what if we used that?

---

name: alpine
template: inverse

# What About Alpine

---

template: code

# Dockerfile: Alpine v1

```Dockerfile
*FROM golang:1.12-alpine
*RUN adduser -D appuser
COPY . /src/
RUN cd /src \
 && go build -o app . \
 && cd / \
 && cp /src/app /app \
 && chown appuser /app \
 && chmod 755 /app \
 && rm -r /go/pkg /root/.cache/go-build /src
USER appuser
CMD [ "/app" ]
```
???
- Not much to change with Alpine, just a different FROM,
  and the adduser syntax changes
---

template: terminal

<asciinema-player src="demo-alpine1.cast" cols=100 rows=26 preload=true font-size=17></asciinema-player>

???
- But when we run that, we don't have git
- Alpine is smaller because it doesn't include lots of stuff

---

template: code

# Dockerfile: Alpine v2

```Dockerfile
FROM golang:1.12-alpine
*RUN apk add --no-cache git ca-certificates
RUN adduser -D appuser
COPY . /src/
RUN cd /src \
 && go build -o app . \
 && cd / \
 && cp /src/app /app \
 && chown appuser /app \
 && chmod 755 /app \
 && rm -r /go/pkg /root/.cache/go-build /src
USER appuser
CMD /app
```
???
- So lets install git, and you may also need other packages
  like certificates if you pull from HTTPS repos

---

template: terminal

<asciinema-player src="demo-alpine2.cast" cols=100 rows=26 preload=true font-size=17></asciinema-player>

???
- So that works
- And again, image size goes down, almost all from the smaller base.
- If you do the math, our code in debian2 (on top of 1.12) is more than alpine2
  (on top of 1.12-alpine) because we needed to install git
- But we are still shipping the compiler
---

name: multi-stage
template: inverse

# Do we need to ship a compiler with our app?

---

template: impact
class: center, middle

# No

???
- I wouldn't ask the question if the answer wasn't "No"
- Even with languages like Java, we could change from a JDK to a JRE

---

template: code

# Dockerfile: Multi-stage v1

```Dockerfile
*FROM golang:1.12-alpine as build
RUN apk add --no-cache git ca-certificates
RUN adduser -D appuser
WORKDIR /src
COPY . /src/
RUN go build -o app .
USER appuser
CMD [ "/src/app" ]

*FROM scratch as release
*COPY --from=build /src/app /app
USER appuser
CMD [ "/app" ]
```
???
- Multi-stage images have multiple "FROM" lines
- This builds multiple images, and tags one of them (by default, the last one)
  - It does not merge multiple images together
- The key is we can copy files from one stage to another
- Our CI server now just needs the docker command, devs select their compiler
  image in the first stage, and minimal runtime in the last stage
- And for my runtime filesystem, I picked scratch, scrach is what you get when
  `rm -rf /` finishes
- There's no shell or libraries to run, so I need that CMD in json, and I need
  a language like Go that can statically compile the binary
---

template: terminal

<asciinema-player src="demo-multi-stage1.cast" cols=100 rows=26 preload=true font-size=17></asciinema-player>
???
- So lets run that... and it fails because the user doesn't exist in scratch
- We only created the user in our build stage, lets fix that in a sysadmin way

---

template: code

# Dockerfile: Multi-stage v2

```Dockerfile
FROM golang:1.12-alpine as build
RUN apk add --no-cache git ca-certificates
RUN adduser -D appuser
WORKDIR /src
COPY . /src/
RUN go build -o app .
USER appuser
CMD [ "/src/app" ]

FROM scratch as release
*COPY --from=build /etc/passwd /etc/group /etc/
COPY --from=build /src/app /app
USER appuser
CMD [ "/app" ]
```
???
- Copy the /etc/passwd and /etc/group files, which contain all the
  user and group mappings to UID/GID's
- I could also copy those Certificates from /etc/ssl if they were needed
---

template: terminal

<asciinema-player src="demo-multi-stage2.cast" cols=100 rows=26 preload=true font-size=17></asciinema-player>
???
- Lets run that... and we get fail number 2
- Lets check the logs... wait, where's the container?
- We ran it with `--rm -d` so the container deletes in the background on exit, lets foreground it
- No such file or directory? Lets check the container and see why it's missing.
- And we don't have a /bin/sh in scratch, lets build a new image to debug

---

template: code

# Dockerfile: Multi-stage v3

```Dockerfile
*FROM golang:1.12-alpine as dev
RUN apk add --no-cache git ca-certificates
RUN adduser -D appuser
WORKDIR /src
COPY . /src/
CMD go build -o app . && ./app

*FROM dev as build
RUN go build -o app .
USER appuser
CMD [ "./app" ]

...
```
???
- So first, this will be relevant later, I'm splitting the developer
  and build stages, dev has the source, build generates the binary
---

template: code

# Dockerfile: Multi-stage v3

```Dockerfile
...

FROM scratch as release
COPY --from=build /etc/passwd /etc/group /etc/
COPY --from=build /src/app /app
USER appuser
CMD [ "/app" ]

*FROM debian as debug
*COPY --from=build /src/app /app
*CMD [ "/app" ]

FROM release
```
???
- More importantly, I'm adding a debug stage, using debian instead of scratch
- And I copy the /app just like I do in release
---

template: terminal

<asciinema-player src="demo-multi-stage3.cast" cols=100 rows=26 preload=true font-size=17></asciinema-player>
???
- Lets run that... and woops, a shell needs input or it will exit...
- See the "no such file or directory" here too, but the file exists, and is executable
- If you google this, you'll probably find a SO post that I've answered saying
  to check the linked libraries, and we see the broken link to libc.musl
- Note, had I picked alpine for my debug image, app would have run just fine

---

template: code

# Dockerfile: Multi-stage v4

```Dockerfile
FROM golang:1.12-alpine as dev
RUN apk add --no-cache git ca-certificates
RUN adduser -D appuser
WORKDIR /src
COPY . /src/
*CMD CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o app . && ./app

FROM dev as build
*RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o app .
USER appuser
CMD [ "./app" ]

...
```
???
- The fix for this, that you'd see from the same SO post, is to turn off CGO
  when you use networking libraries
---

template: terminal

<asciinema-player src="demo-multi-stage4.cast" cols=100 rows=26 preload=true font-size=17></asciinema-player>
???
- Lets run that, and this time it works
- So that was a pain in the butt...
- But our resulting image is a lot smaller, down to 10M, that will speed up the deploys
---

name: dev-workflow
template: inverse

# Developer Workflow

???
- Remember me splitting the dev and build stages, lets use that to make a better
  developer workflow, because these builds take time downloading modules
---

template: terminal

<asciinema-player src="demo-dev-workflow.cast" cols=100 rows=26 preload=true font-size=17></asciinema-player>
???
- The dev can run build the dev target to have the full compiler
- But this time, when running it, I add a bunch of options
- Volumes for /src and HOME map those directories into the container
- I'm setting the GOPATH and HOME variables so the go cache gets saved somewhere persistent
- And I adjust the UID/GID to match my user outside of the container
- This runs a build every time we start up
- And to rerun a build, we can just restart the container
---

template: code

# How I Run Go

```shell
$ cat ~/bin/go
#!/bin/sh

GO_VER=${GO_VER:-1.12}
GO_ORIG=/usr/local/go/bin/go

docker run -it --rm --net host \
  -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" -v "$HOME:$HOME" \
  -e "GOPATH=${HOME}/data/golang" \
  -e CGO_ENABLED \
  -e HOME -w "$(pwd)" \
  golang:${GO_VER} ${GO_ORIG} "$@"
```
???
- All of those variables come from a script that I use for `go`
- I don't even have go installed directly on my laptop, everything is in containers

---

name: buildkit
template: inverse

# Our Builds Are Too Slow

???
- I've been hiding how long these builds take, but every time I run this
  without a cache, go is downloading from github again
- We made the images smaller, but can we make them faster?

---

template: picture

![XKCD - Compiling](img/xkcd.303.compiling.png)
???
- And yes that's good for office shenanigans
- But we can speed them up

---

# Why BuildKit

- Build context is cached and only changes are sent
- Dockerfile is parsed as a dependency graph
- Steps can be run concurrently
- Frontend parser can be swapped for new features
- Build secrets (experimental)
- Mounts to other images or context (experimental)

---

class: small
template: code

# Dockerfile: BuildKit v1 (partial)

```Dockerfile
*# syntax=docker/dockerfile:experimental

FROM golang:1.12-alpine as dev
COPY . /src/

FROM dev as build
*RUN --mount=type=cache,id=gomod,target=/go/pkg/mod/cache \
*   --mount=type=cache,id=goroot,target=/root/.cache/go-build \
*   CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o app .
CMD ./app

FROM scratch as release
COPY --from=build /etc/passwd /etc/group /etc/
COPY --from=build /src/app /app
CMD [ "/app" ]

FROM debian as debug
...
FROM release
```
???
- Here's a BuildKit modified Dockerfile for speeding up a go build
- First line changes the frontend parser to enable experimental features
- The `--mount` option mounts effectively a named volume for that RUN line
- Directory persists between builds, does not get added to the image
---

template: terminal

<asciinema-player src="demo-buildkit1.cast" cols=100 rows=26 preload=true font-size=17></asciinema-player>

???
- Important note, that `--mount` option is not backwards compatible
- Notice how a buildkit run skips the debug stage,
  not needed for release stage
- Good for efficiency, bad for testing, need to inject a hard dependency
  or manually build specific stages
- Populate the cache in both multi-stage and buildkit
- Change a single version number in the go.mod
- Rerunning both shows buildkit skips the download on most modules

---

name: buildx
template: inverse

# Buildx? Another Builder?

---

# Buildx

- Orchestration for your build process
- Layer above BuildKit
- Supports multiple builders
- Supports cross platform builds with builders on multiple nodes

---

class: small
template: code

# Dockerfile: Buildx v1 (partial)

```Dockerfile
...
FROM scratch as release
COPY --from=build /etc/passwd /etc/group /etc/
COPY --from=build /src/app /app
USER appuser
CMD [ "/app" ]

FROM debian as debug
COPY --from=build /src/app /app
CMD [ "/app" ]

*FROM scratch as artifact
*COPY --from=build /src/app /app

FROM release
```
???
- An interesting feature of buildx is to output more than just an image
- Lets make an artifact stage based on scratch, and copy our "app" binary into it
---

template: terminal

<asciinema-player src="demo-buildx1.cast" cols=100 rows=26 preload=true font-size=17></asciinema-player>

???
- Now if I start without an "app" binary in the directory
- Run a build with the `--output` option
- Docker showed this for generating protobuf files, dependency for rest of the build
---

template: inverse

# Multi-Architecture Builds

---

# Multi-Architecture Builds

Three options:

1. Qemu
2. Configure multiple build nodes
3. Cross compiling

???

- Qemu is virtualization loaded into the kernel to run binaries for other platforms
  - Requires binfmt_misc module
- Multiple build nodes with `docker buildx create ...`
- Cross compiling works great with Go

---

class: small
template: code

# Dockerfile: Buildx v2 (partial)

```Dockerfile
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:experimental

*FROM --platform=$BUILDPLATFORM golang:1.12-alpine as dev
RUN apk add --no-cache git ca-certificates
RUN adduser -D appuser
WORKDIR /src
COPY . /src/
CMD CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o app . && ./app

*FROM --platform=$BUILDPLATFORM dev as build
*ARG TARGETPLATFORM
*ARG TARGETOS
*ARG TARGETARCH
RUN --mount=type=cache,id=gomod,target=/go/pkg/mod/cache \
    --mount=type=cache,id=goroot,target=/root/.cache/go-build \
*   CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=${TARGETOS} GOARCH=${TARGETARCH} \
*   go build -ldflags '-w -extldflags -static' -o app .
CMD ./app
...
```
???
- This is option 3, cross compile binary on one platform, 
- The `FROM --platform` flags are needed to pull an image for the build host
  rather than target platform
- Docker gives you the TARGETPLATFORM, TARGETOS, and TARGETARCH arguments
- These options line up nicely with GOOS and GOARCH
- I added even more flags to ensure a static compile
- Only use COPY steps to create target platform image as release, that stage is
  unchanged
---

template: terminal

<asciinema-player src="demo-buildx2.cast" cols=100 rows=26 preload=true font-size=17></asciinema-player>

???

- First, without buildx, we can build platform specific images
- If we try to run it, we get a not found error, but this time for another reason
- Lets mount the qemu binary into the container that the kernel needs
- Success, we are running ARM64 binaries on an AMD64 system
- Buildx lets us build all these together into a multi-arch image
- We do need to push to a registry, local images are a single arch per tag
- The manifest command shows the two arch's from the remote registry
- If we run it, docker automatically pulls our local arch
- We can override the arch, again getting the no such file error
- Adding the qemu binary for the kernel mod allows this to work, this could also be added to the image
- Now we see the expect ARM64 output

```
???
- Some of those flags for static compiling or specifying the architecture
  managed to reduce my image size even more
- Importantly those smaller images also came with:
  - repeatable builds not dependent on developer machines
  - faster builds
  - portability to other platforms
