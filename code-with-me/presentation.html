- My twitter and github handles are what any self respecting sysadmin does
  when you get a permission denied error on your favorite username.
- This presentation is on github and I'll have a link to it at the end,
  I'll be going fast so don't panic if you miss a slide.

# Dockerfile

---

# Dockerfile

- Recipe for creating a docker image
- Every step builds off the previous state
  - Set/change metadata
  - Add a filesystem layer

---

# Dockerfile

- Comments begin the line with a `#`
- Lines may be continued by appending a `\`
- Each step begins with a keyword

---

# Dockerfile

- `FROM openjdk:11-jdk`
- `COPY bin/ /usr/local/bin/`
- `RUN apk add jq`
- `CMD ["node"]`

???

- FROM defines our base image
  - Could say `openjdk:11.0.4-jdk` but may then miss patches like `openjdk:11.0.5-jdk` or `openjdk:11.1-jdk`
- COPY adds a filesystem layer from the build context
- RUN uses a temporary container to add a filesystem layer
  - When the container exits, the only thing saved are container filesystem changes
  - Not running processes, environment variables, or changes to volumes
- CMD defines the default action to take when running a container (image metadata)

---

# RUN, ENTRYPOINT, and CMD

- Either string or json syntax
  - String will use a shell
  - Json will use OS exec syscall
- `RUN` is executed during the build
- `ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD` modify how the container starts
  - `CMD` is easily overridden
  - `ENTRYPOINT` commonly performs initialization
  - Both: `ENTRYPOINT` run with `CMD` as args

???

- String will give you a shell: variable expansion, chaining commands, i/o redirects
- Json will run with the OS exec: no shell that could interfere with signal handling
- A container starts with a single command, and when that command exits,
  the container exits. So if you define both, docker turns that into one command.
- If you use ENTRYPOINT and CMD together, you want the Json syntax

---

# Dockerfile Variables

- `ARG` sets a variable within the Dockerfile, scoped
  - Value overridden with flags on the build command
- `ENV` sets a variable inside the container (image metadata)
- Variables are expanded in steps like `COPY`
- `ARG` and `ENV` are both set as environment variables in `RUN`

???

- An ARG before a FROM applies only to FROM lines
- An ARG after a from line applies to all the following steps, until another FROM line

---

# Dockerfile

- `LABEL` sets an image label
- `EXPOSE` metadata on ports the container will likely use
- `USER` changes the default user for commands
- `WORKDIR` sets the default directory, similar to `cd`
- `VOLUME` breaks things
- `HEALTHCHECK` tells you when things break

---

# Building

- `docker build -t image_name:v1.0.0 .`
- Default name for input is Dockerfile

???

- By default the build creates an image id, we tag that image
- You can later create additional tags, e.g. `v1.0` and `v1` to this same image
- The trailing `.` is very important, this is your build context
- The build context is tar'd up and sent to the docker engine
- Do not tar up your entire `C` drive or user home directory
- Dockerfile begins with a capital D and does not end with a `.txt`

# Docker Compose

---

# Why docker-compose

- `docker run ...` can become very tedious with lots of options
- We can define these options as a config file
- We can deploy multiple containers together
- We can specify volume sources and ports to publish

???

- The image is portable can only define the container side
- The compose file lets you define the other side in a syntax easily audited by local administrators

---

# Docker Compose Versions

- Version 1: long since deprecated, but default
- Version 2.x: useful for local development
- Version 3.x: useful for Swarm mode

???

- Always define a version line in your compose file, you do not want v1 syntax
- Swarm mode is a subset of `docker run` features, cannot run privileged
  containers, and various other administrative container settings
- If you do not depend on those features, use a v3 syntax for forward compatibility

# Sample Compose File

```no-highlight
version: '3.4'
volumes:
  data:
networks:
  frontend:
  backend:
services:
  web:
    image: app:latest
    volumes:
    - "data:/data"
    - "./code:/app"
    networks:
    - frontend
    - backend
    ports:
    - "80:8080"
  redis:
    image: redis:latest
    networks:
    - backend
```

???

- Notice the indentation, that's not just to make it pretty
- This defines 1 volume, 2 networks, and 2 services
- The redis service is only on the backend network, no published port
  - Access via "redis:6379" in web container

---

# YAML

- Used by Docker, Kubernetes, and lots of other apps for config files
- White space sensitive, use spaces
- Comments allowed with `#`
- Backwards compatible with Json
- Array entries start each line with a `-`
- Key/value pairs start each line with a key name followed by a `:`
- Strings may be in quotes

???

- Human readable Json, not necessarily human writable

---

# Docker Compose

```no-highlight
$ docker-compose up -d
$ docker-compose ps
$ docker-compose logs web
$ docker-compose down
```

---

# Swarm Mode Forward Compatibility

```no-highlight
$ docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml app
$ docker stack services app
$ docker stack ps app
$ docker service logs app_web
$ docker stack rm app
```

???

- The v3 syntax is forward compatible with Swarm mode

```no-highlight
git clone https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app.git
cd example-voting-app
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose down

docker swarm init --advertise-addr eth0
docker stack deploy -c docker-stack.yml vote
```

Tips:
- ssh helps with fast typing
- Ports 5000 and 5001 are interesting
- Example URL: http://ip172-18-0-14-asdfasdfasdfasdfasdf-5000.direct.labs.play-with-docker.com/

???

- If you do not see the CPU/Mem show up when creating an instance, close session and restart
- For the port, if you do not get a link, copy the ssh and adjust with a "-5000" or other port number
