???

- This talk is geared towards people that have a working knowledge of docker.

- Most of this talk is answering different questions, if you get lost at any
  point, sit tight for a minute and we'll get to a different question.

- I've answered almost 1k questions on the docker tag on SO. But why?

---

# How Do We Learn?

???

- I wanted to learn Docker inside out. Partially for curiosity, partially
because I really enjoyed working with it, and mostly because it was my new job.

--

- RTFM

- Practice

- Drills

- Teaching

???

- Docker has some fine docs, and where it's lacking, you can always submit PR's.

- Play With Docker gets you quick practice.

- Drills to me is working through a list of questions, and implies that the
  answer is already there and you're just trying to remember it.

- Teaching requires you learn something well enough to explain it to others.

- The last two sum up StackOverflow for me.

- I don't learn docker so I can answer questions

- I answer questions so I can learn docker

---

# Typical StackOverflow User Background

- Mostly developers

- Often more comfortable with an IDE than a CLI

- DevOps is shifting those Devs into more Ops tasks

- Pro: devs no longer depend on ops to manage their app runtime environment

--

- Con: devs no longer depend on ops to manage their app runtime environment

- Devs are now learning OS/Linux/distributions, scripting, package managers,
  networking, and storage.

???
- The result: lots of smart developers making common mistakes.

# General Docker Questions

---

# Q: How do containers differ from VM's

- Containers have a shared kernel, application isolation vs hardware isolation

- How do we change the mindset of people using containers as a lightweight VM?

???

- Namesapces and cgroups, not virtualized hardware.

- Yet people still cram 5 different apps into a single container and upgrade
  in place, how do we change that?

--

  - Who likes uptime?

???

- Everyone with their hands down are probably texting their boss to explain why
  everything is down equals "working as designed".

--

  - Who wants to maintain a server that hasn't been rebooted for 3 years, and
    the original admin has left?

???

- It's got uptime, probably vulnerable to spectre/meltdown and lots of other
  exploits, along with being a really old framework no one likes.

--
  - Uptime quickly becomes a ticking time bomb.

???

- Upgrades are out of the question since you don't know what could break or how
  to fix it or how to revert. There's a transition point where uptime goes from
  desired to risky.

- That transition point is as soon as you get state drift.

--

- What we want is availability, not uptime. We want a LB pointing to replicas
  spread across multiple AZ's so we can have __low uptime__ and __high availability__.

???

- The fix is continuous delivery, infrastructure as code, immutability and disposability.

- People using containers as lightweight VM's are making pets, they'll end up
  a 3 year old container that no one knows how it works. Those doing it right
  will manage a farm of cattle.

---

# Q: How do containers differ from VM's

Practical differences:

- Don't ssh into containers (exec, and only in dev)

- Don't upgrade containers in place (replace them)

- Don't install multiple apps inside a single container (compose files)

- Don't give containers static IP's (LB/reverse proxies)

- Don't backup containers (backup volumes)

- Don't export containers to make new images (use a Dockerfile)

???

- Treat containers as immutable and disposable.

- Learn from others mistakes:

  - The worst answer I had to give to someone was that they wasted months of work
    and had to start all over.
  - They had been maintaining their container without a Dockerfile, applying
    updates in place, and periodically running an export / import. 
  - One day they lost their image, maybe they ran a bad rmi, maybe filesystem
    corruption, maybe they hit the layer limit.
  - A Dockerfile and versioned images would give them not only a quick way to
    revert, but also to completely recreate without some of the day 1 cruft.

---
# Q: Can I use docker to run different OS's?

???

- People asking this question often want to run Windows binaries on Linux
  using docker.

--
## A: Nope
--
*

.small[*terms and conditions apply]

---
# Q: Can I use docker to run different OS's?

The base of the OS is the kernel, docker containers run on the same kernel.

```
$ uname -v
#1 SMP Debian 4.9.82-1+deb9u3 (2018-03-02)

$ docker run --rm ubuntu uname -v
#1 SMP Debian 4.9.82-1+deb9u3 (2018-03-02)

$ docker run --rm centos uname -v
#1 SMP Debian 4.9.82-1+deb9u3 (2018-03-02)

$ docker run --rm alpine uname -v
#1 SMP Debian 4.9.82-1+deb9u3 (2018-03-02)
```

---
# Q: Can I use docker to run different OS's?

Terms and Conditions:

- Base images are an OS to some people.

- Docker runs on different platforms.

- Swarm can include nodes from different platforms.

- Desktops typically include embedded VMs.

- Default `runc` can be swapped for a VM runtime.

???

- The OS images each give a different base filesystem, different libraries,
  different package managers, and upstream repos to pull packages.

- Docker does run on multiple OS's, e.g. linux x86-64, linux arm64, windows,
  ppc64, s390. The image needs to match that OS arch, and we now have manifests
  that can point to multiple images using a single name.

- Swarm mode can have a mix of nodes running different OS's.

- Desktops typically run inside a VM running LinuxKit. MacOS is not a supported
  OS, Linux runs with xhyve. Windows has a HyperV solution for Linux.

- The runtime can be changed to launch VM's instead of containers.

---

# Q: How do I pick a base image?

--

## A: It depends.

???

- Variety is why Docker took off, you're not locked into someone else's
  "right answer"

--

- Stick with tools you know

- Leverage existing open source resources

- Minimize your overhead and attack surface

- Statically compile binaries

???

- RHEL environments often use CentOS

- Debian is a common base for existing open source projects

- Alpine and Busybox have very small attack surfaces

- Scratch is used for no base image at all

# Dockerfile

---

# Q: Why doesn't RUN work?

Why am I getting `./build.sh` is not found?
```
RUN cd /app/src
RUN ./build.sh
```

--

- The only part saved from a RUN is the filesystem (as a new layer).

- Environment variables, launched daemons, and the shell state are all
  discarded with the temporary container when pid 1 exits.

???

- `RUN` launches a temporary container and executes the command.

--

- Solution: merge multiple lines with `&&`:

```
RUN cd /app/src && ./build.sh
```

???

- I've also seen `set -e` used with a multi-line run command

- You want to be sure to exit with an error if any command fails

---

# Q: Do I use ENTRYPOINT or CMD?

- Either alone have the same effect.

- CMD is overridden by 
  ```
  docker run my_image ${cmd}
  ```

- ENTRYPOINT is overridden by 
  ```
  docker run --entrypoint ${entrypoint} my_image
  ```

- Used together, docker runs `${entrypoint} ${cmd}`

???

- Some use entrypoint as the command being run, e.g. Docker's UCP containers
  run the "ucp" command. While CMD is all the args to that command, like "install"

- In practice, I use entrypoint to initialize the container.

- I make the entrypoint transparent, performing an exec on the command at the end

- Initialize activities include:

  - Importing secrets into environment variables
  - Adjusting UID/GID to match volume mounts
  - Injecting an init command like tini
  - Using gosu to drop from root to user

---

# <span class="bg-white">Q: What's the difference between the string and json syntax?</span>

- RUN, CMD, and ENTRYPOINT can each use either syntax

- The string syntax includes a shell, `/bin/sh -c "${cmd}"` by default.

- The json syntax executes the command directly, without a shell.

???

--

.left-column[
Shell Pros:
- Expands variables
- Command chaining (`&&`)
- I/O redirection
]

--

.right-column[
Shell Cons:
- Intercepts signals
- Extra processing to merge entrypoint with cmd
]

---

# <span class="bg-white">Q: What's the difference between the string and json syntax?</span>

String/Shell Syntax:

```
RUN echo hello world
ENTRYPOINT /entrypoint.sh
CMD run a b c
```

--

Json/Exec Syntax:

```
RUN ["echo", "hello", "world"]
ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]
CMD ["run", "a", "b", "c"]
```

???

- If you have any typos, invalid quotes, missing commas or bracket, docker will
  treat the bad json as a string to run.

---

# <span class="bg-white">Q: What's the difference between the string and json syntax?</span>

What if cmd is a string and you have an entrypoint?

```
/entrypoint.sh /bin/sh -c "args to entrypoint"
```

--

To fix this in the entrypoint:

```
#!/bin/sh
if [ $# -gt 1 -a "$1" = "/bin/sh" -a "$2" = "-c" ]; then
  shift 2
  eval "set -- $1"
fi
exec "$@"
```

???

- The final `exec` is what makes an entrypoint transparent to the command being
  run. Pid 1 gets replaced by the command and any initialization may be done
  before the command is executed.

---

# Q: Why can't I extend this image?
```
FROM busybox as parent
CMD echo hello cmd
FROM parent
COPY entrypoint.sh /
ENTRYPOINT [ "/entrypoint.sh" ]
```

```
$ cat entrypoint.sh
#!/bin/sh
echo hello entrypoint
exec "$@"
```

What does this output?

???

- If you don't recognize the `FROM` lines, this is using a multi-stage build
  to simulate extending one image with another image. It could have been two
  different Dockerfiles.

- Again, the entrypoint is transparent, passing through the command at the end.

- Does this output "hello entrypoint", "hello command", both, or neither?

---

# Q: Why can't I extend this image?

```no-highlight
$ docker run -it --rm test-entrypoint
hello entrypoint
$
```

- Typically a child image will extend it's parent image, and any metadata
  will be inherited.

--

- One exception: when setting an `ENTRYPOINT` the value of `CMD` from parent
  images is nulled out.

???

- This avoids unexpected behaviors if a parent image changes from an entrypoint
  to a command.

---

# Q: Why doesn't build use the cache?

.left-column[
Cache requires:

- Same command to be run

- Same checksum on all files

- Same previous layer

- Image was built locally
]

--

.right-column[
Cache can be broken by:

- Changing a build `ARG` value

- Changing a timestamp

- The previous layer being rebuilt
]

--

.no-column[
To trust images pulled from a registry, use:
```
docker build --cache-from my_image ...
```
]

---

# Q: Should I use COPY or ADD?

## A: Use COPY 
--
(when possible)

--

ADD provides additional features which comes with additional overhead:

- Pulls URL's

- Extracts tar files including compressed files

???

- Tar file extraction must be local, not a URL

- Compressed files includes gzip, bzip, and xz

- If you wanted a tar file copied into the image, this could result in
  unexpected behaviors

---

# Q: Should I use COPY or ADD?

Both ADD and COPY:

- Cannot access local files outside of the build context

- Create a directory in the container if needed

- Copy the contents of the directory rather than the directory itself

- Default to creating files with uid/gid 0

  - Use `--chown` and `--chmod` to correct permissions

???

- Most every base image starts with an `ADD` command to populate the root
  filesystem.

- The build context is the trailing `.` in many build commands.

- Since docker is a client/server tool, everything needed to perform the build
  must be sent to the server in the build command, and docker does not provide
  access to the host outside of the context.
---

# <span class="bg-white">Q: Can I define runtime options in a Dockerfile?</span>

## A: Nope
--
... that's what a compose file is for.

.left-column[
The Dockerfile cannot:

- Specify the image name

- Publish ports

- Mount volumes

- Add capabilities
]

--

.right-column[
Consider the security vulnerabilities if you could.
]

???

- Building an image is considered a fairly safe operation, what if a shared
  build environment created an image that labeled itself alpine:latest?

- Docker ships secure by default

- The main risk out of the box is a DoS attack

- Options like these each expose a potential risk

  - Could mount a volume allowing an attacker to read or write every file on the host

  - Could grant capabilities that allow the process to break out of the container

- Leave it up to the person running the image to decide if an how to take that risk

---

# Q: Why is my image so large?

How big are the layers resulting from this Dockerfile:
```
FROM busybox

RUN mkdir /data
RUN dd if=/dev/zero bs=1024 count=1024 of=/data/one
RUN chmod -R 0777 /data
RUN dd if=/dev/zero bs=1024 count=1024 of=/data/two
RUN chmod -R 0777 /data
RUN rm /data/one

CMD ls -alh /data
```

???

- 5 commands:
  - Create 1M /data/one
  - Change permissions
  - Create 1M /data/two
  - Change permissions
  - Remove /data/one

- This could easily be:
  - Download code from git
  - Extract code
  - Compile app
  - Make app executable
  - Remove download and source

---

# Q: Why is my image so large?

- Running the image you see the 1MB file:
  ```
  -rwxrwxrwx    1 root     root        1.0M May 12 00:14 two
  ```

- Each `dd` command adds a 1MB layer.

--

- Each `chmod` command will change permissions and copy the entire 1MB file
  to the next layer.

--

- What does the `rm` command do to the image size?

---

class: small

# Q: Why is my image so large?

The `rm` command only changes directory metadata in the next layer:


```
Step 6/7 : RUN chmod -R 0777 /data
 ---> Running in 038bd2bc5aea
* ---> 77793bf30d5f
Step 7/8 : RUN rm /data/one
 ---> Running in 504c6e9b6637
* ---> 9fe0e2f18893
...

$ docker image ls -a | grep 77793bf30d5f
REPOSITORY     TAG           IMAGE ID         CREATED             SIZE
<none>         <none>        77793bf30d5f     10 minutes ago      6.37MB
$ docker image ls -a | grep 9fe0e2f18893
REPOSITORY     TAG           IMAGE ID         CREATED             SIZE
<none>         <none>        9fe0e2f18893     10 minutes ago      6.37MB
```

---

# Q: Why is my image so large?

- Resulting 1MB file has become 4MB on disk and over the network

- Compare the two resulting images to see the added disk space:
  ```
  REPOSITORY   TAG     IMAGE ID      CREATED         SIZE
  busybox      latest  54511612f1c4  8 months ago    1.13MB
  test-layers  latest  757ce49dd12f  10 minutes ago  6.37MB
  ```

- Subtracting the two you get the expected ~5MB

---

# Q: Why is my image so large?

- 5MB? Not 4MB? Where did the extra 1MB come from?

```
FROM busybox
RUN mkdir /data
RUN dd if=/dev/zero bs=1024 count=1024 of=/data/one
RUN chmod -R 0777 /data
RUN dd if=/dev/zero bs=1024 count=1024 of=/data/two
RUN chmod -R 0777 /data
RUN rm /data/one
CMD ls -alh /data
```

--

- A `chmod` or `chown` changes a timestamp on the file
  _even when there is no permission or ownership change made_.

???

- The recursive `chmod` and `chown` commands you run to fix permissions and run
  will always include every file in that directory in the new layer.

---

# Q: Why is my image so large?

How can we examine layers? Build with `docker build --rm=false .`

```
...
Step 2/7 : RUN mkdir /data
* ---> Running in 04c5fa1360b0
 ---> 9b4368667b8c
Step 3/7 : RUN dd if=/dev/zero bs=1024 count=1024 of=/data/one
* ---> Running in f1b72db3bfaa
1024+0 records in
1024+0 records out
1048576 bytes (1.0MB) copied, 0.006002 seconds, 166.6MB/s
 ---> ea2506fc6e11
```

???

- This leaves the temporary containers around used during the build

- Docker used to leave them around by default, but they took up space and
  people rarely used them

- Until now...

---

# Q: Why is my image so large?

Check each temp image with `docker diff ${cid}`

.small[
```
$ docker diff 04c5fa1360b0  # mkdir /data
A /data
*$ docker diff f1b72db3bfaa  # dd if=/dev/zero bs=1024 count=1024 of=/data/one
C /data
*A /data/one
*$ docker diff 81c607555a7d  # chmod -R 0777 /data
C /data
*C /data/one
$ docker diff 1bd249e1a47b  # dd if=/dev/zero bs=1024 count=1024 of=/data/two
C /data
A /data/two
*$ docker diff 038bd2bc5aea  # chmod -R 0777 /data
*C /data/one
*C /data/two
$ docker diff 504c6e9b6637  # rm /data/one
C /data
*D /data/one
```
]

???

- The `/data/one` file is created once with `A`, changed twice (`C`), and then
  it's deleted (`D`) which also changes the metadata on `/data`.

- Each of these `docker diff` commands is a view into the layered filesystem,
  and every layer is shipped with an image, it's not squashed automatically.

---

# Q: Why is my image so large?

### Reducing image size by merging RUN lines:

.small[
```
FROM busybox

RUN mkdir /data \
 && dd if=/dev/zero bs=1024 count=1024 of=/data/one \
 && chmod -R 0777 /data \
 && dd if=/dev/zero bs=1024 count=1024 of=/data/two \
 && chmod -R 0777 /data \
 && rm /data/one

CMD ls -alh /data
```
]

The previous 5MB is now just 1MB:

```
REPOSITORY    TAG      IMAGE ID      CREATED             SIZE
busybox       latest   54511612f1c4  8 months ago        1.13MB
test-layers2  latest   951252cf34ed  25 seconds ago      2.18MB
```

???

- Merge the `RUN` commands by joining each command with a `&&` and span
  multiple lines with a `\`.

- Do the same when downloading source or temporary files, same with
  apt-get update/clean, do those in the same RUN line.

---

template: inverse

# Run

---

# Q: What does "invalid reference format" mean?

- A reference is a pointer to an image.

- The docker command line is order dependent:
  ```
  docker ${docker_args} run ${run_args} image ${cmd}
  ```

- Frequently happens when an invalid arg gets parsed as the image name or
  invalid characters from copy/pasting from a source that changes dashes
  and quotes.

- What does docker interpret as the image name here:
  ```
  my project$ docker run -it —rm -v $(pwd):/data “my_image”
  ```

???

- References can be the image name and tag, name and default to latest, image id,
  with or without a registry, or it can be pinned to a sha256 hash.

- The first thing after the run command that isn't a valid arg is treated as
  the image reference.

- Commonly see with wrong type of `-`, "smart" quotes, unquoted paths with spaces.

- In the example, there are three different errors, `--rm` has an em-dash,
  the volume path isn't quoted and contains a space, and left/right quotes 
  are used around my_image.
  - First: `—rm`
  - Next: `project:/data`
  - Then: `“my_image”` (with left/right quotes)
 
---

# Q: Why do I get "executable not found"?

- Did you run the intended command?
  ```no-highlight
  docker run --rm my_image -it echo hello world
  ```

- Is docker trying to run a json string?

- Does the file exist... in the path and inside the container?

- If it is a shell script, check the first line 
  ```no-highlight
  #!/bin/bash
  ```

- Check for windows linefeeds on linux shell scripts

- If it is a binary, there is likely a missing library

???

- The `-it` is not an executable, everything after my_image is a command to run

- If docker is trying to run your "json" CMD/ENTRYPOINT, there's likely a typo
  or other invalid json causing it to be processed as a string.

- People try to run commands on their laptop inside the container. We have
  filesystem namespacing, which means containers cannot see the laptop directories
  (unless you have a volume mount). The path for exec may not have everything
  an interactive shell in the container has, login scripts aren't run.

- If it's not executable, fix it with a `chmod`, preferably in the same layer where
  the file was created to reduce layer size.

- Alpine, busybox, and some other images don't ship with bash out of the box.

- Statically compiled go libraries still have some library dependencies without 
  a few extra flags. If you compile on ubuntu and run on alpine, the musl libc
  will not work.

---

# Q: What is this TTY error?

```no-highlight
the input device is not a TTY
```

- The TTY is a terminal in linux

- `docker run -it`: Interactive terminal

- `docker run -i `: Input but no terminal, piping in a file

- `docker run -t `: Setup terminal but no input, color output in logs

- `docker run    `: No input, no terminal, typically used for scripts/cron/ci-cd

???

- A terminal is more than just a stream of text, lets the cursor move around and
  supports colors.

- This error is typically seen when you run docker by a script or in some
  automation tool (Jenkins).

---

# Q: Why is tail broken?

This tail command never shows lines written to the logfile:

```
$ docker run -d --name test-tail --rm debian tail -f /etc/issue
*$ docker exec test-tail /bin/sh -c \
*  'ls -l /etc/issue; \
*   echo hello container >>/etc/issue; \
*   ls -l /etc/issue'
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 26 Jul 13  2017 /etc/issue
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 42 May 14 15:50 /etc/issue
$ docker logs test-tail
Debian GNU/Linux 9 \n \l

$
```

???

- This is a contrived example, /etc/issue is any log file that already
  exists inside the image to allow the tail command to work.

- Sometimes this is IO buffering. Try using `stdbuf -i0 -o0 -e0 tail x` to
  run tail without buffering.

---

# Q: Why is tail broken?

This error comes from the docker copy-on-write, note the inode numbers:
```
$ docker run -d --name test-tail --rm debian tail -f /etc/issue
$ docker exec test-tail /bin/sh -c \
  'ls -il /etc/issue; \
   echo hello container >>/etc/issue; \
   ls -il /etc/issue'
*41813820 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 26 Jul 13  2017 /etc/issue
*41031155 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 42 May 14 15:58 /etc/issue
$ docker logs test-tail
Debian GNU/Linux 9 \n \l

$
```

???

- When the tail command starts, it follows the inode of the file in the image fs

- After the echo command, the CoW happens, the file is copied into the container
  fs, and the file you see in the container is not the same file being tailed

---

# Q: Why is tail broken?

Fix it by modifying the file before starting the tail command:

```
$ docker run -d --name test-tail --rm debian /bin/sh -c \
*  ':>>/etc/issue && exec tail -f /etc/issue'
```

???

- The `:` command is a "noop"

- The `>>` will then append nothing to the file

- But a timestamp on the file will be updated, forcing a CoW

- I use a shell to join two commands together with `&&`

- And `exec` is used to replace the shell in pid 1 with `tail`

---

# Q: Why is tail broken?

Now adding a line to the file shows in the logs:

```
$ docker exec test-tail /bin/sh -c \
  'ls -il /etc/issue; \
   echo hello container >>/etc/issue; \
   ls -il /etc/issue'
41031155 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 26 Jul 13  2017 /etc/issue
41031155 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 42 May 14 16:04 /etc/issue
$ docker logs test-tail
Debian GNU/Linux 9 \n \l

*hello container
```

???

- Now the inode number is unchanged during the exec because the file
  was already copied on the container startup.

- These same inode issues affect mounting a single file as a volume in
  containers. Changing the file on either side creates a new inode and file
  and the changes are only visible from the side that changed.

- To solve this with volumes, mount a directory instead of a single file if
  you plan on editing that file.

# Networking

# Q: EXPOSE vs Publishing a port?

- EXPOSE

  - Documentation from the image creator to the person running the image

  - Not needed to publish

  - Not needed for container-to-container communication

- Publish

  - Maps a port on the host to connect to a port in the container.

  - One-way, from host to container, it does not allow containers
    to access applications running on the host.

???

- Neither of these apply to container-to-container communication.

---

# <span class="bg-white">Q: Networking issues between containers?</span>

- Make sure to listen on 0.0.0.0, not 127.0.0.1

- Use a user generated network

- Connect to the container port, not the host published port

- Use DNS: container id, container name, service name, or network alias

- Check the overlay networking ports on your firewalls

???

- When moving an app from host to container, networking needs to change
  to use multiple namespaced networks instead of a global host network.

- Overlay ports: 7946/both, 4789/tcp, and protocol 50

---

## Follow-up Q: Do I need to expose the port?
- Nope, expose is documentation.

## Follow-up Q: Do I need to publish the port?
- Nope, that only makes the container accessible from outside of docker.

## Follow-up Q: Do I need links?
- Nope, links are deprecated, use user created networks.

???

- Any container with a common user created network can talk to every port
  of the other container, no expose, publish, or linking needed.

- Linking is what we had before user generated networks, you still need that
  if you don't create a network for your container, but it's not recommended.

--

## Follow-up Q: What's a network alias?
- You can give containers or services additional names on any network.

???

- Aliases are many-to-many. One container can have many of aliases. Many
  containers can have the same alias (DNSRR).

---

# <span class="bg-white">Q: Why can't my container reach an app on my host using 127.0.0.1?</span>

- Container networking is namespaced.

- By default, each container gets it's own loopback interface (127.0.0.1).

- Solutions:
  - Bad: Use host networking
  - Ok: Connect to another interface on the host
  - Best: Move the host app into a container

---

# Q: Issues accessing published port?

- Make sure the app is listening on that port, and on `0.0.0.0`:

```
docker run -it --rm --net container:${cid} \
  nicolaka/netshoot netstat -lnt
```

???

- Loopback doesn't work for published port either.

- There are several network types: host, overlay, bridge, and none. There's
  also using the network namespace of another container.

--

- Verify the publish command. `-p 8080:80` maps host port 8080 to container
  port 80.

???

- Docker doesn't control how the app listens, only where the forwarded
  traffic goes

- Every container can listen internally on the same port without conflict,
  that's what network namespacing gives you. People often reverse the port
  order. My way of remembering is you can publish to a specific IP on the
  host, and if so, that's `host_ip:host_port:container_port`

--

- Avoid IPv6 issues, connect to `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost`. Do not
  try to connect to `0.0.0.0`.

???

- IP `0.0.0.0` is only for servers listening, not clients connecting. The
  web server listens on all network interfaces, but the web browser only
  connects to a single IP address.

--

- With overlay networking, open 7946/both, 4789/tcp, and protocol 50.

???

- Overlay networking needs ports opened between docker nodes in the swarm.
  Protocol 50 is not tcp or udp, it's a different protocol, for IPSec only.

--

- <span class="bg-white">
  Verify the docker host you are using with `echo $DOCKER_HOST`. If this is
  set, connect to that IP instead.</span>

???

- IP `0.0.0.0` is only for servers listening, not clients connecting. The
  web server listens on all network interfaces, but the web browser only
  connects to a single IP address.

# Volumes

---

# Q: Build isn't updating a directory?

- Sometimes the image is updated, and a volume is mounted over that directory.

- Named volumes only get initialized on container create when the volume
  is empty. Host volumes never get initialized by docker.

- Volumes defined in the Dockerfile prevent future changes to that directory.

---

# PSA: Remove VOLUME in Dockerfiles

- Users cannot extend the image with initialized data.

- Anonymous volumes are created that clutter the filesystem.

- Named and host volumes do not require the volume defined in the image.

???

- Anonymous volumes are where data goes to get lost.

--

- Solution: define volumes in the compose file.

---

# <span class="bg-white">Q: How do I handle UID/GID and permission issues with host volumes?</span>

- Option 1: `chmod 777`

- Option 2: Update image user to match host uid/gid

- Option 3: Use named volumes an manage data with containers

- Option 4: Correct permissions with entrypoint

???

- Opt 1 is a cop-out

- Opt 2 is not portable

- Opt 3 works as long as you don't need host volumes

- Opt 4 requires suid command or starting container as root

---

## <span class="bg-white">Q: How do I handle UID/GID and permission issues?</span>

Update image to match host uid/gid:

```
FROM debian:latest
ARG UID=1000
ARG GID=1000
RUN groupadd -g $GID cuser \
 && useradd -m -u $UID -g $GID -s /bin/bash cuser
USER cuser
```

```
$ docker build \
  --build-arg UID=$(id -u) --build-arg GID=$(id -g) .
```

???

- Only need to match uid/gid, username and groupname can be different

- Not portable if UID/GID isn't common across all docker hosts

---

## <span class="bg-white">Q: How do I handle UID/GID and permission issues?</span>

Using named volumes:

```no-highlight
# Populate named volume
$ tar -cC source . | docker run --rm -i -v vol:/target \
    busybox /bin/sh -c "tar -xC /target && chown -R 1000 /target"

# Use or initialize empty volume from image
$ docker run -d -v vol:/data my_image

# Backup/export named volume
$ docker run --rm -v vol:/source busybox tar -czC /source . \
  >backup.tgz
```

???

- Named volumes get initialized with the directory contents from the image,
  including uid/gid and permissions of those files/directories

- Managing a named volume is a bit more complicated, you use a utility
  container to add/remove/backup/etc.
---

## <span class="bg-white">Q: How do I handle UID/GID and permission issues?</span>

Entrypoint to correct uid/gid:

```
FROM jenkins/jenkins:lts
*USER root
RUN  apt-get update \
* && wget -O /usr/local/bin/gosu "https://github.com/..." \
  && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/gosu \
  && curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh \
  && usermod -aG docker jenkins
*COPY entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh
*ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]
```

???

- To use an entrypoint I've:
  - run the container as root
  - installed gosu
  - created the user/group
  - copied in the entrypoint

- I've removed error handling and cleanup steps to fit on the slide

---

## <span class="bg-white">Q: How do I handle UID/GID and permission issues?</span>

Entrypoint to correct uid/gid:

```no-highlight
#!/bin/sh

# if image and volume gid do not match, modify container user
SOCK_DOCKER_GID=$(ls -ng /var/run/docker.sock | cut -f3 -d' ')
CUR_DOCKER_GID=$(getent group docker | cut -f3 -d: || true)
if [ "$SOCK_DOCKER_GID" != "$CUR_DOCKER_GID" ]; then
*  groupmod -g ${SOCK_DOCKER_GID} docker
fi

# drop access to jenkins user and run jenkins entrypoint
*exec gosu jenkins /bin/tini -- /usr/local/bin/jenkins.sh "$@"
```

???

- I've removed error handling and cleanup steps to fit on the slide

- The last line:
  - `exec` removes the shell from pid 1, replaces with `gosu`
  - `gosu` drops access from root to jenkins, and does an internal exec to `tini`
  - `tini` is a small init to reap zombie processes, and launches `jenkins.sh`
  - `jenkins.sh` runs the app

- Done this way, the entrypoint is transparent to the user and container process,
  they only notice the file permissions in the container always match where ever
  they run the container

- A `docker exec` will still run as root, but app will run as jenkins

---

# Q: How to initialize a host volume from image?

- Option 1: Don't. Initialize outside of docker, before starting the container

- Option 2: Copy with an entrypoint from a saved location in the image.

???

- Opt 1: pay attention to uid/gid's.

- Opt 2: if the image is run without a host vol, then use a symlink inside
  the image from /data to /data-save

--

- Option 3: Define a named volume that's a bind mount.

```no-highlight
$ docker volume create --driver local \
  --opt type=none \
  --opt device=/home/user/test \
  --opt o=bind \
  test_vol
```

???

- Opt 3: Docker will initialize named volumes, but the directory must exist in
  advance for the bind mount to succeed (unlike host volumes)

---

## Q: How to initialize a host volume from image?

Walk-through of example 3 - Dockerfile:

```no-highlight
FROM busybox:latest
RUN adduser --home /home/user --uid 5001 \
    --disabled-password user
USER user
*COPY --chown=user sample-data/ /home/user/data/
```

???

- We've made a user, and copied in some sample data to the image.

---

## Q: How to initialize a host volume from image?

Walk-through of example 3 - Sample data:

```
$ ls -al sample-data/
total 24
drwxr-xr-x  3 bmitch bmitch 4096 Jan 22  2017 .
drwxr-xr-x 30 bmitch bmitch 4096 May 14 09:41 ..
drwxr-xr-x  2 bmitch bmitch 4096 Jan 22  2017 dir
-rw-r--r--  1 bmitch bmitch   14 Jan 22  2017 file2.txt
-rw-r--r--  1 bmitch bmitch   12 Jan 22  2017 file.txt
-rw-r--r--  1 bmitch bmitch  214 Jan 22  2017 tar-file.tgz
```

???

- This gets loaded into the image

---

## Q: How to initialize a host volume from image?

Walk-through of example 3 - create volume:

```no-highlight
*$ mkdir test-vol

*$ ls -al test-vol
total 8
drwxr-sr-x  2 bmitch bmitch 4096 May 14 09:40 .
drwxr-xr-x 30 bmitch bmitch 4096 May 14 09:33 ..

*$ docker volume create --driver local --opt type=none \
* --opt device=$(pwd)/test-vol --opt o=bind test-vol
test-vol
```

???

- We have to create the directory on the host first, same for any 
  bind/nfs/etc mount.

- The volume create could also be done in a compose.yml file. Slightly
  different syntax.

---

## Q: How to initialize a host volume from image?

Walk-through of example 3 - Run the container:

```no-highlight
$ docker run -it --rm -v test-vol:/home/user/data test-vol \
  /bin/sh -c "\
    echo hello world >/home/user/data/inside-container.txt \
    && ls -l /home/user/data"
total 20
drwxr-xr-x  2 user   user   4096 May 14 13:43 dir
-rw-r--r--  1 user   user     12 Jan 23  2017 file.txt
-rw-r--r--  1 user   user     14 Jan 23  2017 file2.txt
*-rw-r--r--  1 user   user     12 May 14 13:43 inside-container.txt
-rw-r--r--  1 user   user    214 Jan 23  2017 tar-file.tgz
```

???

- Run the container, using the named volume mount

- Volume was initialized even though it's a "host" volume

- Created the "inside-container.txt" file by the container

- Note the container owns everything as "user"

---

## Q: How to initialize a host volume from image?

Walk-through of example 3 - Show the local directory from the host:

```
$ ls -al test-vol/
total 28
drwxr-sr-x  3   5001   5001 4096 May 14 09:43 .
drwxr-xr-x 30 bmitch bmitch 4096 May 14 09:41 ..
drwxr-xr-x  2   5001   5001 4096 May 14 09:43 dir
-rw-r--r--  1   5001   5001   14 Jan 22  2017 file2.txt
-rw-r--r--  1   5001   5001   12 Jan 22  2017 file.txt
-rw-r--r--  1   5001   5001   12 May 14 09:43 inside-container.txt
-rw-r--r--  1   5001   5001  214 Jan 22  2017 tar-file.tgz
```

???

- Note the uid matches the image uid, this doesn't solve the uid mapping issue

- Combine this with previous uid/gid entrypoint fix for best of both
